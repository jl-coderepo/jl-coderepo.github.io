                Hello, I'm June and welcome to my profile page. I am a 
                budding software engineer based in California. My 
                professional interests lies generally in software 
                development, but particularily interested in becoming a 
                full stack devloper.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my undergraduate studies and after graduating from 
                UCLA my primary occupation was in contracting 
                (specifically in tenant improvement for commercial). 
                However, that is not where my passion lies and now be 
                able to move on from contracting and cultivate my skills 
                in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that my personal interests lies in fitness. 
                I've been slowly improving my fitness levels 
                where now I am able to finish a half-marathon, obstacle
                course races and everyday improving my ability in lifting 
                heavy objects.
